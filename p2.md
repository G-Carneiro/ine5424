# P2: Time-preemptive Scheduling

Adapt the systems you have developed so far to support time-preemptive scheduling and prepare your system to go multicore for P3. 
Modifications are expected, but not limited to the following components in order to make your system multicore-ready: CPU, IC, Timer, Machine, Thread, Scheduler, Alarm, Heap, SETUP and SYSTEM. 
However, Thread and Scheduler will be evaluated only at P3.
You can assume a Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) model for your multicore design. 
If your solution requires additional handling, please, add detailed instructions to a readme.txt file to the project's root directory.
